			</div>
			<div class="article column2">
				<p> Both private and purpose foundations in Mauritius are governed by the Foundations Act 2012, which provides a comprehensive regulatory framework for the establishment, administration, and dissolution of foundations. Key features of foundations in Mauritius include:

                    Separate Legal Personality: Foundations have legal personality distinct from their founders, beneficiaries, and council members, enabling them to own assets, enter into contracts, and engage in legal transactions in their own name.
                    
                    Perpetual Existence: Foundations enjoy perpetual existence, meaning they can continue to exist indefinitely, even beyond the lifetimes of their founders or beneficiaries, ensuring long-term continuity in pursuing their objectives.
                    
                    Council or Administrator: Foundations are managed by a council or administrator appointed in accordance with the foundation's charter or regulations. The council or administrator is responsible for overseeing the foundation's activities, managing its assets, and ensuring compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.
                    
                    Flexibility in Governance: Foundations have flexibility in structuring their governance arrangements, including the composition and powers of the council or administrator, decision-making processes, and distribution of assets.
                    
                    Confidentiality: Mauritius provides a high level of confidentiality and privacy for foundations, with strict provisions protecting the confidentiality of information relating to the foundation's affairs, beneficiaries, and transactions.
                    
                    Tax Neutrality: Foundations established for purposes other than carrying on business activities in Mauritius are generally tax-exempt, providing a tax-neutral environment for managing assets and pursuing philanthropic or charitable objectives.</p>

			<div class="article column3">
				<p>In Mauritius, foundations offer a versatile and effective vehicle for various purposes, including philanthropy, wealth management, estate planning, and asset protection. There are primarily two types of foundations recognized under Mauritian law:

                    Private Foundations:
                    Private foundations are established for the benefit of a specific person or group of persons, known as beneficiaries. The assets of a private foundation are dedicated to achieving the foundation's objectives, which may include providing financial support to family members, managing inheritances, or supporting charitable causes. Private foundations in Mauritius offer flexibility in structuring and managing assets while ensuring confidentiality and privacy for the beneficiaries. They are commonly used for estate planning, succession planning, and wealth preservation purposes.
                    
                    Purpose Foundations:
                    Purpose foundations are established to pursue specific non-charitable purposes or objectives, rather than benefiting identifiable individuals. These objectives can include promoting education, advancing scientific research, supporting cultural initiatives, or preserving the environment. Unlike private foundations, which benefit individuals, purpose foundations aim to achieve broader societal or organizational goals. Purpose foundations in Mauritius offer a structured legal framework for managing endowments, grants, and donations aimed at advancing the foundation's stated purpose while ensuring transparency and accountability in governance.</p>

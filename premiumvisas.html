				<p>Mauritius offers a Premium Visa for non-citizens who wish to reside in Mauritius for an extended period without the need for a work or business permit. This visa is known as the Premium Travel Visa (PTV). Here's an overview of the Premium Travel Visa in Mauritius:</p>
			</div>
			<div class="article column1">
				<p>Premium Travel Visa (PTV):

                    Purpose: The PTV is designed for individuals who wish to stay in Mauritius for a long duration, typically for tourism, retirement, or remote work purposes.
                    
                    Duration: The visa allows for a stay of up to 1 year initially, with the option for renewal for a total stay of up to 3 years.
                    
                    Eligibility: The PTV is open to non-citizens who meet the eligibility criteria set by the government of Mauritius. Applicants must demonstrate proof of sufficient funds to support themselves during their stay and must have valid health insurance coverage for the duration of their visa.
                    
                    Application Process: The application process for the PTV typically involves submitting the required documentation, including proof of financial means and health insurance, to the relevant authorities in Mauritius. Applicants may also need to undergo a medical examination as part of the application process.
                    
                    Benefits: Holders of the PTV are allowed to stay in Mauritius for the approved duration without the need for a work or business permit. They have the flexibility to travel in and out of Mauritius during their stay. However, the visa does not grant the right to engage in employment or business activities in Mauritius.
                    
                    Renewal: The PTV can be renewed for additional periods, typically up to a maximum total stay of 3 years, subject to meeting the renewal criteria set by the Mauritian authorities.
                    
                    Cost: There are fees associated with applying for the PTV, including visa processing fees and any applicable service charges.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="article column2">
				<p>Eligibility Criteria: The PTV is open to non-citizens of Mauritius who are at least 50 years old. However, there are no age restrictions for individuals who intend to work remotely from Mauritius. Applicants must demonstrate proof of financial means to support themselves during their stay in Mauritius and must have valid health insurance coverage.

                    Health Insurance Requirement: One of the key requirements for obtaining the PTV is having valid health insurance coverage for the entire duration of the stay in Mauritius. This requirement ensures that individuals have access to healthcare services during their time in the country.
                    
                    Financial Means: Applicants are required to demonstrate proof of sufficient funds to support themselves and any accompanying dependents during their stay in Mauritius. The specific financial requirements may vary, and applicants should consult the relevant authorities for the latest information.
                    
                    Application Process: The application process for the PTV typically involves submitting the required documentation, including a completed application form, proof of financial means, valid health insurance coverage, and any other supporting documents as requested by the Mauritian authorities. Applicants may need to apply through a designated agency or directly to the Passport and Immigration Office of Mauritius.
                    
                    Flexibility: Holders of the PTV have the flexibility to enter and exit Mauritius multiple times during the validity period of the visa. This allows individuals to travel abroad and return to Mauritius without the need for additional visas or permits.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="article column3">
				<p>Renewal: The PTV can be renewed for additional periods, typically up to a maximum total stay of 3 years, subject to meeting the renewal criteria set by the Mauritian authorities. Renewal applications must be submitted before the expiration of the current visa.

                    Cost: There are fees associated with applying for the PTV, including visa processing fees and any applicable service charges. The cost may vary depending on factors such as the duration of stay and the number of dependents included in the application.
                    
                    Overall, the Premium Travel Visa offers a convenient and flexible option for individuals seeking to spend an extended period in Mauritius for leisure, retirement, or remote work purposes. It provides an opportunity to experience the beauty and lifestyle of Mauritius while enjoying the benefits of a secure and welcoming environment.</p>
